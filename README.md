# OpenBSD Manual Pages Installer for Linux

I made this script to have access to OpenBSD man pages _and other docs_ locally on my Linux system primarily for cross platform C development.

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the binary build process was [inspired by Arch Linux](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/mandoc/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD?ref_type=heads#L34) (my current distro), it should still work on all distributions nevertheless.

> > Refer to the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` part for more details.
